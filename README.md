# üß¨ Blood Cell Detection Using YOLOv10

AI-powered, image-based blood cell detection system using the latest YOLOv10 object detection algorithm  
Built with Python, Ultralytics YOLOv10, Roboflow, OpenCV, and Gradio

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project applies real-time object detection to microscopic blood smear images to identify and count **Red Blood Cells (RBCs)**, **White Blood Cells (WBCs)**, and **Platelets**.  
It utilizes the newly released **YOLOv10** architecture for enhanced accuracy and speed. The model was trained using a custom-labeled dataset prepared via Roboflow and deployed with an interactive **Gradio web interface** for live predictions.
